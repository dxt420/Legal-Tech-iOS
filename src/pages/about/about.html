      <p >Technology is shaping tomorrowâ€™s society where there will be more and more legal implications of technology. The responsibility to handle the new dynamics of our society by providing valuable counsel and policy direction lies with us. We believe that a humane digital future can only be built together.</p>

<p padding>We therefore invite software developers, designers, digital entrepreneurs, innovators and legal engineers to showcase their innovations and engage lawyers, firms, and regulators in dialogue.</p>

<p padding>The conference will provide rich networking opportunities and establish a deep understanding of the future of the legal practice amidst an evolving business eco-system with technology at its helm.</p>
